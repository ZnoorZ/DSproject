Purpose : To recognize human activity (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

Methodology : Analyze Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Data Set Characteristics:Multivariate, Time-Series
 
Associated Tasks:Classification

Dataset Info: 
* The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
* Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
* Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
* The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.

Pre-processing of Signals:
* The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
* The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity.
* The Butterworth filter is a type of signal processing filter designed to have a frequency response as flat as possible in the passband. It is also referred to as a maximally flat magnitude filter.
* The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.

Attribute Info:
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
-  Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
-  Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 

A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 

10299 instances
-  Its activity label. 
-  An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
